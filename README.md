The goal of the research on fetal health
categorization using machine learning is to create a model that
can precisely predict the condition of a fetus during pregnancy.
This is crucial because prompt action following early
identification of fetal health issues might enhance the
pregnancy's outcome. This research study suggests classifying
fetal health status using machine learning approaches based on
ultrasound images and other clinical parameters. To train and
test our model, we will gather a sizable dataset of ultrasound
images and clinical characteristics from pregnant women. To
categorize the state of fetal health, the proposed model will
employ machine learning algorithms and image processing
techniques. Our approach should categorize fetal health status
with a high degree of accuracy, and it will help obstetricians
and gynecologists provide better treatment for pregnant
patients.
